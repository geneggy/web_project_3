## Question for Reviewer
Can you elaborate on what CSS for the fonts I should be copying from Figma for each text element?  I guess what I'm asking is what properties are default and do not need to be stated.  

I omitted the font-family from everywhere but page.css and only declare font-style and font-weight if they are not "normal".

font-family: Inter;
font-style: normal;
font-weight: normal;

font-size: 18px;
line-height: 30px;

Thank you!!
